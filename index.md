I am a Computer Science major at CSUF  and I plan to graduating 2026

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs:

Lab 6, part 1
This lab was a good example of how restaurants use tablets or kiosks to take orders from customers.
It showed how to use command-line arguments and how std::vector helps to organize data in a simple way.

Lab 8, part 2
This lab was fun because we got to code a pattern, but it was also quite challenging.
It was a great way to understand how loops work, especially outer and inner loops.
By creating the pattern, we could see and trace how the loops worked each time it printed something.

Lab 11, part 1,
This lab was both tricky and challenging, but it helped me understand more about how to use classes.
It showed how just a few lines of code can extract useful information from a large file 
with a lot of information.
